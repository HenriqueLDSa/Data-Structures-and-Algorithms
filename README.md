# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository is a comprehensive collection of implementations for various data structures and algorithms, written primarily in C and Java. It serves as a valuable resource for learning and understanding the fundamentals of computer science concepts.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into several directories, each focusing on specific topics:

- **1D-Array, 2D-Arrays:** Examples and operations on 1D and 2D arrays implemented in Java.
- **Booths-Algorithm:** Implementation of Booth's Algorithm for multiplication in C.
- **Bubble-Sort-Number-of-Swaps:** Bubble Sort algorithm demonstrating the number of swaps, written in C.
- **Conditional-LL-Insertion:** Conditional linked list insertion operations in C.
- **FileIO-LL-Operations:** File I/O operations with linked lists in C.
- **Hash-Tables:** Basic implementation of hash tables in C.
- **Heap-Sort:** Heap Sort algorithm examples in C.
- **Inserting-Node-LL:** Techniques for inserting a node into a linked list in C.
- **Palindrome-Check-Stacks:** Using stacks to check for palindromes in C.
- **Recursive-Binary-Search:** Implementation of the recursive binary search algorithm in C.
- **Sorting-Algorithms:** Various sorting algorithms (e.g., Quick Sort, Merge Sort) implemented in C.
- **Tries-Num-of-Occurances:** Implementation of tries to count the number of occurrences of words in C.

Each directory contains a `README.md` file with specific instructions and explanations related to the concepts and code.

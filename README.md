# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository is a comprehensive collection of implementations for various data structures and algorithms, written primarily in C and Java. It serves as a valuable resource for learning and understanding the fundamentals of computer science concepts.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into several directories, each focusing on specific topics:

- **1D-Array, 2D-Arrays:** Examples and operations on 1D and 2D arrays implemented in Java.
- **Booths-Algorithm:** Implementation of Booth's Algorithm for multiplication in C.
- **Bubble-Sort-Number-of-Swaps:** Bubble Sort algorithm demonstrating the number of swaps, written in C.
- **Conditional-LL-Insertion:** Conditional linked list insertion operations in C.
- **FileIO-LL-Operations:** File I/O operations with linked lists in C.
- **Hash-Tables:** Basic implementation of hash tables in C.
- **Heap-Sort:** Heap Sort algorithm examples in C.
- **Inserting-Node-LL:** Techniques for inserting a node into a linked list in C.
- **Palindrome-Check-Stacks:** Using stacks to check for palindromes in C.
- **Recursive-Binary-Search:** Implementation of the recursive binary search algorithm in C.
- **Sorting-Algorithms:** Various sorting algorithms (e.g., Quick Sort, Merge Sort) implemented in C.
- **Tries-Num-of-Occurances:** Implementation of tries to count the number of occurrences of words in C.

Each directory contains a `README.md` file with specific instructions and explanations related to the concepts and code.

## Getting Started

To explore and run the programs:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory of the topic you're interested in.
3. Compile and excecute the `main` file, according to each language.

### Compiling C Programs

To compile a C program, use the GCC compiler with the following command:

```
gcc program_name.c -o program_output_name
```

For example, if you have a file named `main.c`, you can compile it to an executable named `main` like this:

```
gcc main.c -o main
```

Then, run the program with:

```
./main
```

### Compiling Java Programs

To compile a Java program, use the `javac` compiler:

```
javac ClassName.java
```

For example, if your Java class is in a file named `Main.java`, you would compile it like this:

```
javac Main.java
```

This generates a `Main.class` file that you can run with the `java` command:

```
java Main
```

Make sure your `java` command is run from the same directory where your `.class` file is located, or specify the classpath to where the file resides.
